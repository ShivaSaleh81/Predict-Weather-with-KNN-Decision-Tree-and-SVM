# Predict Weather with KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict weather conditions for the following day based on historical weather data. By implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the project aims to analyze patterns in weather data and forecast future conditions accurately.
